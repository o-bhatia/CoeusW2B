# Coeus
Coeus is an OCR app designed for Android-based mobile devices, and targets individuals in professional settings (i.e.
within the workplace, school, etc.) or everyday users. Its primary functionality is to scan handwritten notes or 
printed text and convert it into digital media, stored on the user's phone in a separate directory. There is a secure
Google Sign-in to protect your previously scanned documents, and you can easily view the files while using the app. 

We were able to accomplish Coeus using Google Vision (for more details see here: https://cloud.google.com/vision/),
Realm (for more details see here: https://realm.io/products/realm-database/) and Apache PDFBox (for more details see here: 
https://pdfbox.apache.org/).
